# 🚀 Stochastic Interest Rate Modeling: Vasicek and Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) Models  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops and implements the **Vasicek** and **Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR)** stochastic interest rate models using **Excel** to capture **mean-reverting dynamics** in interest rates and reflect realistic economic conditions.

## 🔬 Methodology  

- **Model Implementation**  
  - Developed Vasicek and CIR models in Excel.  
  - Captured mean reversion, volatility, and equilibrium behavior.  

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
  - Conducted **20 simulations** for each model.  
  - Visualized short-term interest rate evolution under stochastic shocks.  

- **Market Calibration (MLE)**  
  - Applied **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** to estimate key parameters:  
    - Speed of mean reversion (𝑎)  
    - Long-term equilibrium mean (𝑏)  
    - Volatility of rates (σ)  

- **Comparative Analysis**  
  - Evaluated Vasicek vs. CIR for market conditions:  
    - Vasicek → allows negative rates (useful in low/negative rate regimes).  
    - CIR → ensures strictly positive rates (better for stable/realistic rate modeling).

## 📊 Key Outcomes  

- Demonstrated practical differences between Vasicek and CIR frameworks.  
- Produced simulation charts and calibration outputs validating model alignment with U.S. Treasury data.  
- Built an **Excel-based quantitative finance toolkit** for stochastic modeling without coding.  
- Strengthened understanding of **interest rate modeling, calibration techniques, and risk analysis**.
